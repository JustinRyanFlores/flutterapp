## About The Project <a id="about-the-project"></a>

### Overview <a id="overview"></a>

Construction industry is a determinant of the country's technological and technical advancement, often regulating the growth of the country's infrastructural development that often directs to the country's advancement in terms of sustainability assurance (Hussain et. al, 2022). Having an online presence has been a defining factor for the success of most businesses in the present time. E- commerce is considered to be an effective method for promoting, selling and incorporating online services that can play an important role in customer recognition, acquisition and maintenance. Through the innovations in the system, businesses can also promote services, replacing the conventional process, which is cheaper and more efficient. (P. R. Pathmanathan et al.,2021). 

According to Malloy, Q. (2019), customers can buy any product from any e-commerce in the world without having to leave their workplace or home. Due to bad weather, economic and health situations, or any other reason, many people cannot go shopping. Additionally, e-commerce services allow its consumers to have a better understanding and determine the benefits of each product and services that a business offers. The platform allows customers to compare products based on different factors such as price, features, and quality.

In a recent survey conducted by National Bureau of Statistics (2019), it is reported that 70% of construction companies perceive that they will be out of business if they will not adapt to the digital transformation and E-commerce era. Whereas, 62% experts believe that the construction industry is way behind the other industries in terms of adopting digital transformation and E-commerce solutions.For large and small companies, ICT and e-Business are essential for promoting incorporation and cooperation with business associates, vendors and consumers, as well as making electronic transactions. It provides consumers with support, helps produce and accept sales and orders at a fast level, lowers inventory time, and costs (Khahro. et al.,2021).

### Purpose <a id="purpose"></a>
Its main objective of the project is to offer a streamlined ordering system for a variety of hardware tools and construction supplies, catering to multiple users in the area. This service will be beneficial to clients who prefer the convenience of remote ordering, thereby optimizing time efficiency for all end users involved. Additionally, the proposed system will be promoting growth and innovation in the construction industry by encouraging digital transformation and expanding the reach of each business compared to the traditional method. It can also potentially encourage collaboration and networking among different professionals in the industry to cultivate a better understanding of the various potential of e-commerce in the business.

Moreover, the system will also benefit the consumer because of the reduced time and user-friendly sourcing of materials for construction and hardware. It will provide features that allow customers to compare different products based on preferences such as on price,quality, and reviews of other customers as well. With the implementation of the system, it will aid in bridging the gap between traditional and modern age of commerce and customer service which will benefit both the consumers and business professionals.

### Limitations and Constraints <a id="limitations"></a>
One of the most common limitations in an e-commerce business are technical difficulties, technological and marketing cost, shipping problems, scalability, and possible security risk. Now all of this is addressed and plan to reduce and possibly eliminate these limitations to ensure that a smooth flow of process and transactions are achieved through the system.
