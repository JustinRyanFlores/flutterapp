<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project <a id="about-the-project"></a>

### Overview <a id="overview"></a>
The construction industry is a determinant of a country's technological and technical advancement, often regulating the growth of infrastructural development that directs to sustainability assurance (Hussain et. al, 2022). Having an online presence has been a defining factor for the success of most businesses in the present time. E-commerce is considered an effective method for promoting, selling, and incorporating online services that can play an important role in customer recognition, acquisition, and maintenance. Through innovations in the system, businesses can promote services, replacing the conventional process, which is cheaper and more efficient (P. R. Pathmanathan et al., 2021).

According to Malloy (2019), customers can buy any product from any e-commerce in the world without leaving their workplace or home. Due to bad weather, economic and health situations, or any other reason, many people cannot go shopping. Additionally, e-commerce services allow consumers to better understand and determine the benefits of each product and service a business offers. The platform allows customers to compare products based on different factors such as price, features, and quality.

In a recent survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (2019), it is reported that 70% of construction companies perceive they will be out of business if they do not adapt to the digital transformation and E-commerce era. Moreover, 62% of experts believe that the construction industry is way behind other industries in adopting digital transformation and e-commerce solutions. For large and small companies, ICT and e-Business are essential for promoting incorporation and cooperation with business associates, vendors, and consumers, as well as making electronic transactions. It provides consumers with support, helps produce and accept sales and orders at a fast level, and lowers inventory time and costs (Khahro et al., 2021).

### Purpose <a id="purpose"></a>
The main objective of the project is to offer a streamlined ordering system for a variety of hardware tools and construction supplies, catering to multiple users in the area. This service will benefit clients who prefer the convenience of remote ordering, optimizing time efficiency for all end users involved. Additionally, the proposed system will promote growth and innovation in the construction industry by encouraging digital transformation and expanding the reach of each business compared to traditional methods. It can also potentially encourage collaboration and networking among different professionals in the industry to cultivate a better understanding of the various potentials of e-commerce in the business.

### Objectives <a id="objectives"></a>
- To design an intuitive interface that allows users to add and check out items.
- To include informative product information and descriptions for informed decision-making on checking orders.
- To provide a platform for construction businesses to integrate e-commerce solutions for the industry.
